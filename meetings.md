# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE:** 12.2.2020 at 10:20
* **ASSISTANTS:**

### Minutes

During the meeting we discussed about the purpose of this first excercise and corrected few of the misconseptions we had about the first deadline. The main point made during the discussion during the meeting was that the purpose of the first deadline was not to focus on the techical implementation of the API but rather serve as a base level sketch to guide us in development of the API.

### Action points

We were told to first correct our writings considering the first deadline to reflect the actual requirements. Nothing was said about points other than that our Wiki still requires work.
