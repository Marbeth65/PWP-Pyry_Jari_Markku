INFORMATION CONCERNING MOBILE CLIENT

Folder named "Mobile" contains a Java client that is designed to run on android. It has been optimised for
nexus 10 device that can be found from Android Studio application. When this client is ran it will automatically load
all paymentplans contained in "dummyhandle" -handle and list them using list adapter. To the left in each view of listview can 
be seen provider of the current paymentplan and other values can be seen to the right.

In order to test that mobile client you need to

1) Get your application to run in port 0.0.0.0 by initiating flask command "flask run -h 0.0.0.0" in terminal after setting FLASK_APP to
CICalculator

2) Populate the database with either dummydata or normal data. This can be done with flask testgen -function that generates 15 dummy paymentplans.
If you want to generate your own data, you will have to name your handle "dummyhandle". All paymentplans committed to this handle should be now obtainable
by client. Remember to select Nexus 10 as the active device from android studio emulators since client has been optimised for that screen size.
