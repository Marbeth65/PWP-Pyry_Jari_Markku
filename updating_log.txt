This textfile contains information about changes to our wiki and code alike. Changes are listed under headlines that are used in this courses scoring sheet.

Deadline 1, "At least two more examples of clients are provided".

Added two more examples of use for our client. Assumed increase in points: 0.5


Deadline 1 headlines "An example of a client that uses this API is provided" and "An additional API is provided"

Added Imgur api as an additional example and described briefly what that client does. Also explained briefly how we are going to use
that API in our own project. Assumed increase in points: 1 (2x 0.5).

Deadline 1 "Relations among concepts is clear" and "A diagram that shows relations between concepts is provided"

Added a diagram that includes structure of our database models. Should give 1 point (2x 0.5)

Deadline 1 assumed increase is 2.5

Deadline 2 headlines "Each model and its attributes...", "Details for arrtributes..." and "Foreign keys follow..." and 
"Table in the previous section..."

Added table of each model and its attributes. Table covers all models and theyr attributes. Assumed increase 2.25 (0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5)

Deadline 2 headline "Methods in the test are correctly..."

Commented tests extensively. Assumed increase 0.5

Deadline 2 assumed increase 2.75

Deadline 3 header "Api uses correctly the uniform interface."

Modified PUT request so that it now requires body. Assumed increase 0.5

Deadline 3 header "Resouece table with URLs..."

Added resource table. Assumed increase 0.5

Deadline 3 header "Each request has correct media type"

Added table. Assumed increase 0.5

Deadline 4 header "instructions to set up API and run..."

Added some additional information about setting up our api and running our client and running our tests. Assumed increase 0.5, from 0.5 to 1

NOTE! This seems to be a duplicate bullet since deadline 5 has identical header. I am going to go ahead and assume that it will also
add 0.5 points as promised in grading sheet. So total is 1 point.

Deadline 4 header "You have clearly marked which parts..."

Added documentation to my hypermedia that links to lovelace section from which I took core of my modified function. Hypermedia.py in utils directory.
Also added comment to my getResource function in paymentplans.js to tell that that function has been taken from lovelace. Paymentplans.js in static, line 130.
Assumed increase 0.5.

Deadline 4 "Each methods functionality is described in its documentation"

Added documentational descriptions to all the resources. Assumed increase 1.

Deadline 4 "Test cases cover all predictable error scenarios"

Deadline 4 assumed increase 4

Deadline 5 header "Workflow diagram available..."

Added workflow diagram consisting of 4 screenshots that were edited. Assumed increase 1 points

Deadline 5 header "Instructions to set up..."

This is duplicate header and was already fixed in deadline 4. So I assume it increases my points with 0.5
